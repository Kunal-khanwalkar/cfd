Perpetuity is a Story-Driven Text based game where the player takes control of a person who is a drug addict, and how his life goes downhill because of it's influence. The drugs are an integral part of his daily life and it depends on you to help the player lose his drug addiction and get his life back on line. The choices you make in the game will affect your final outcome.
The game is made entirely on C++ and it uses winmm library for Sounds.
